   - Results include frequency, flux, and error for each source. Example output:
     ```
     FREQ = 1.42E+00   FLUX = 4.50E+01   ERR = 1.81E+01
     ```

## **Configuration Example**

A typical photometry configuration file includes:
- `mode`: Method for combining fluxes (e.g., `'median'`).
- `effective_beam_area`: Effective area in degÂ² for scaling.
- `maps`: List of input maps (defined in `files.py`).
- `targets`: List of sources to analyze (defined in `source.py`).

## Measuring Uncertainties in Flux Calculations

The flux and its associated error are calculated by summing pixel brightnesses from the primary aperture and accounting for various uncertainties. Below, we describe how the flux and errors are derived from the code and physical considerations.

### 1. Primary Flux Calculation
The primary flux is calculated as the sum of the pixel brightnesses in the aperture:
\[
F_{\text{primary}} = \sum_{i} I_i
\]
where \( I_i \) represents the intensity of the \( i \)th pixel in the primary aperture.

### 2. Background Flux and Error Calculations
The background flux is estimated using pixels outside the primary aperture, typically taken as the mean or median:
\[
F_{\text{background}} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{background}}} \sum_{j} I_j^{\text{background}}
\]
The error in this background flux, considering variance from multiple background regions, is:
\[
\text{Var}_{\text{background}} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{background}}} \sum_{j} \left(I_j^{\text{background}} - \langle I_{\text{background}} \rangle \right)^2
\]

### 3. Random and Calibration Error Components
The total error in the flux calculation is derived from two main sources:

#### a) Calibration Error
The calibration error accounts for inaccuracies in the calibration of the data:
\[
\text{Var}_{\text{calibration}} = (F_{\text{primary}} \cdot \text{calibration\_error})^2
\]

#### b) Random Error
The random error accounts for noise in the data and variations in the background:
\[
\text{Var}_{\text{random}} = \text{Var}_{\text{background}} \times N_{\text{primary}}
\]
where \( N_{\text{primary}} \) is the number of pixels in the primary aperture.

### 4. Scaling Noise by Beam Area
To estimate noise more accurately in low signal-to-noise (S/N) regions, we can scale the random noise by the number of independent beams in the primary aperture:
\[
N_{\text{independent}} = \frac{\text{primary\_area\_deg}^2}{\text{effective\_beam\_area}}
\]
The random error is scaled by the ratio:
\[
\text{scaled\_random\_var} = \text{Var}_{\text{random}} \cdot \left(\frac{N_{\text{primary}}}{N_{\text{independent}}}\right)
\]

This scaling corrects for the underestimated noise when there are significant variations in the astrophysical signal across the background.

### 5. Total Variance and Final Error
The total variance is the sum of the random and calibration variances:
\[
\text{Var}_{\text{total}} = \text{Var}_{\text{random}} + \text{Var}_{\text{calibration}}
\]

The final error is calculated as the standard deviation:
\[
\text{Error} = \sqrt{\text{Var}_{\text{total}}}
\]

### 6. Signal-to-Noise Considerations
In high S/N regions, the calibration error dominates, while in low S/N regions, the random noise is more significant. This behavior reflects the relative contribution of each uncertainty to the total error in flux measurements.

## **Advanced Options**


- **Custom Bandpasses**:
   - Modify `bandpasses.py` to handle instrument-specific colour corrections:
     ```python
     from bandpasses import fastmficc
     corrected_value = fastmficc(nu=17, alpha=0.1)
     ```
